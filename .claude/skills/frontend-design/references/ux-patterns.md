# UX Rendering Patterns

Visual rendering rules for common UI elements.

## Forms
- Single-column layout
- Visible labels above fields (not placeholder-only)
- Smart defaults, minimal fields

## Empty States
- Relevant icon + explanation + CTA button
- New users live here — make it welcoming and actionable
- Example: "No projects yet. Create your first one."
- NEVER leave a blank empty state without guidance

## Error States
- Specific message + recovery path
- NOT "Something went wrong"

## Labels
- Labels are a last resort — emails, dates, prices are self-evident
- Strip labels, emphasize the data itself

## Buttons
- Show hover/active/disabled states
- Destructive actions = warning styling
- Disabled buttons need adjacent text explaining why

## Navigation
- Clear hierarchy, current location highlighted
- 5-7 top-level items max

## Content
- Realistic content: real names, plausible data, actual copy
- NEVER "Lorem ipsum", "Click here", "Title"
- Copy as design: specific > generic, user's language, say what happens not what the system does
